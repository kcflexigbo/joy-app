# Joy's Dinner Reminder Application

A simple, friendly, and slightly romantic webpage for Joy that reminds her about dinner at 6 PM with a live countdown and some charming touches.

## Overview

This application consists of two main components:

1. **Frontend** - A React application with TypeScript that displays the countdown timer and personalized messages
2. **Backend** - A FastAPI (Python) API that provides personalized information to the frontend

The application serves as a reminder for Joy about dinner at 6 PM. It displays:
- A personalized greeting
- A warm reminder message
- A real-time countdown timer to 6:00 PM
- A celebration animation when it's time for dinner
- Rotating sweet nothing messages that change every 5 seconds

## Features

### Personalized Greeting
Displays an affectionate greeting for Joy with a warm message about the upcoming dinner.

### Countdown Timer
Shows a real-time countdown to 6:00 PM using local time, updating every second with remaining time in HH:MM:SS format.

### Celebration at Dinner Time
When the countdown reaches zero, the timer changes to a celebratory message with a gentle confetti animation.

### Sweet Nothing Messages
Features rotating short, sweet messages in the footer that change every 5 seconds, adding to the romantic atmosphere.

### Romantic Design
Uses soft color gradients and tasteful animations to create a charming user experience without being overwhelming.
